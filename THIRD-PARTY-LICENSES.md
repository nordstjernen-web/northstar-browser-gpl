# Third-party software notices

Northstar links to (and in some cases statically includes) the
following open-source libraries. Their copyright notices and license
texts are reproduced below. For libraries shipped dynamically in the
release bundles, you are entitled by the LGPL terms to replace them
with modified versions; the binary will continue to function with any
ABI-compatible replacement.

Distributed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 1.1, the
GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1, or the GNU General Public
License 2.0, at your option. The full license texts are available at:

### GTK 4, GLib, Pango, gdk-pixbuf — GNU LGPL 2.1 or later

> UI toolkit and core utilities.
> <https://www.gtk.org>, <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib>,
> <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango>,
> <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdk-pixbuf>

> Copyright the GNU Project and contributors.

These libraries are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 2.1, or (at your option) any later version. The full
license text is available at:

  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>

Per LGPL section 6, since Northstar links to these libraries
dynamically, you are entitled to modify them and re-link Northstar
against the modified copies. On Windows / macOS bundles the libraries
are shipped alongside the executable as ordinary DLLs / dylibs that you
can replace; on Linux distributions they are loaded from the system
package manager.

### FFmpeg — libavformat / libavcodec / libavutil / libswscale / libswresample — GNU LGPL 2.1 or later (optional, inline WebM)

> Container demuxing and audio/video decoding for the inline WebM path
> (VP9/VP8 video, Opus/Vorbis audio). <https://ffmpeg.org>
>
> Copyright the FFmpeg developers.

Only present when Northstar was built with WebM support. The Windows
release bundles MSYS2's `mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg`, a GPL build of
FFmpeg; the enabled VP8/VP9/Opus/Vorbis decoders are FFmpeg's own
implementations. FFmpeg's licensing terms are documented at:

  <https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html>

The libraries are linked dynamically: on the Windows bundle they ship
beside the executable as ordinary DLLs you can replace and re-link
against; on Linux they are loaded from the distribution's FFmpeg
packages.

### Cairo — LGPL-2.1 or MPL-1.1

> 2D drawing.
> <https://www.cairographics.org>
>
> Copyright Carl Worth, Behdad Esfahbod, and the Cairo contributors.

Dual-licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or the
Mozilla Public License 1.1. See:

- <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>
- <https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/1.1/>

### librsvg — GNU LGPL 2.1 or later (Windows / macOS bundles)

> SVG renderer used by gdk-pixbuf to decode SVG images on Windows
> and macOS. Not linked on Linux (system gdk-pixbuf provides its own
> SVG loader).
> <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg>
>
> Copyright the GNU Project and contributors.

Licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or
later. See the LGPL section above for terms and obligations.

### Optional dynamic dependencies

These are linked only when present on the build host (meson
`required: false`). When a build bundles them, their notices apply:

- **libavif** — BSD 2-Clause, © the AOMedia / libavif authors. AVIF
  image decoding.
- **Poppler** (`poppler-glib`) — GNU GPL 2.0 or later, © the Poppler
  developers. PDF rendering. Note: Poppler is GPL; a build that links it
  is subject to the GPL for that combined binary.
- **Fontconfig** — MIT-style license, © Keith Packard and contributors.
- **FreeType** — FreeType License (BSD-style with credit clause) or GNU
  GPL 2.0, at your option, © The FreeType Project.

## AI models

Northstar does **not** bundle any AI model. The optional local AI
assistant lets you download a model of your choice at runtime; the model
weights are fetched from Hugging Face and stored in your profile, never
shipped with Northstar. The models offered are licensed by their
respective creators as follows, and your use of a downloaded model is
governed by that model's license:

### Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct — Llama 3.1 Community License Agreement

> Offered as the "large" option. Quantized GGUF redistributed by
> bartowski; the underlying weights are Meta's.
> <https://www.llama.com/llama3_1/license/>
>
> Llama 3.1 is licensed under the Llama 3.1 Community License,
> Copyright © Meta Platforms, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

**Built with Llama.** Per the Llama 3.1 Community License Agreement, this
attribution is displayed prominently in the application's "About"
dialog. The full Llama 3.1 Community License Agreement is available at
the URL above and applies to your use of the downloaded model. The
Acceptable Use Policy is at
<https://www.llama.com/llama3_1/use-policy/>.

### Qwen2.5 0.5B / 1.5B Instruct — Apache License 2.0

> Offered as the "fast" (0.5B) and "balanced" (1.5B) options.
> <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct>
> <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct>
>
> Copyright (c) Alibaba Cloud.

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See the lexbor section
above for the license text (same license).

### Qwen2.5 3B Instruct — Qwen Research License Agreement

> Offered as the "quality" option.
> <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct/blob/main/LICENSE>
>
> Copyright (c) Alibaba Cloud.

Unlike the 0.5B and 1.5B Qwen2.5 models, the 3B model is **not** Apache
2.0. It is released under the Qwen Research License Agreement, which
permits research and other non-commercial use only. Review that license
before selecting this model for any commercial deployment.

## NOTICE files

Apache 2.0 section 4(d) requires propagating any `NOTICE` files
shipped with the upstream sources. As of this release:

- lexbor ships no `NOTICE` file.
- Wuffs ships no `NOTICE` file.

If a future upstream release adds one, it will be included verbatim
in this section.
