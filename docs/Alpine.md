# Alpine Linux packaging

`data/packaging/APKBUILD` builds Nordstjernen from source on Alpine
(musl) with `abuild`. It produces a minimal package: the `nordstjernen`
and `nordstjernen-renderer` binaries plus icons, the desktop file, the
i18n catalogues and the license — **nothing is bundled**. Every runtime
library (GTK 4, libcurl, OpenSSL, libwebp, libavif, poppler-glib, …) is
resolved from Alpine system packages, and `abuild`'s `tracedeps` derives
the `depends=` automatically from the linked shared objects, so the
dependency list is always exactly what the binary needs.

The local-AI start page is disabled for this package (`-Dai=disabled`).
That is what keeps the build offline: the AI feature pulls llama.cpp
through a `wrap-git`, which would clone during the network-isolated
`build()` phase and fail on Alpine's builders. With AI off, the only
subproject is the vendored Wuffs (already in the source tarball), so the
build needs no network at all. The browser is otherwise complete.

## License — important

Nordstjernen is released under the **Nordstjernen Source License v1.0**
(`License.md`), a Functional-Source-License-style *source-available*
license with a "Competing Use" restriction (it converts to MIT only on
the tenth anniversary of each release). This is **not** an OSI-approved
or free-software license.

Alpine's official `aports` (main/community/testing) require free /
OSI-approved licenses, so Nordstjernen **cannot be accepted into the
official Alpine repositories as-is**. This APKBUILD is therefore intended
for a **personal / custom Alpine repository**. Official inclusion would
require relicensing the project under an OSI-approved license first.

## Build and install locally (custom repo)

```sh
# On Alpine, as a user in the abuild group:
sudo apk add alpine-sdk
abuild-keygen -a -i

# From a checkout of this repo:
cd data/packaging
abuild -r              # fetches the pkgver source tarball, builds, packages

# Install the result:
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted \
    ~/packages/*/$(uname -m)/nordstjernen-<pkgver>-r0.apk
```

`abuild -r` installs `makedepends`, downloads the source during the
network-allowed fetch phase, then builds offline.

## Updating the version

Bump `pkgver` in `data/packaging/APKBUILD` to the new release tag, reset
`pkgrel=0`, then refresh the checksum:

```sh
cd data/packaging
abuild checksum        # rewrites sha512sums from the fetched tarball
```

The `source=` URL points at the GitHub release tarball
`.../archive/refs/tags/$pkgver.tar.gz`. Note that GitHub's
auto-generated archive checksums are not guaranteed stable forever; if a
checksum mismatch appears, re-run `abuild checksum`.

## Submitting to official aports (only after relicensing)

If the project is relicensed under an OSI-approved license, the steps to
propose it for `aports` would be:

1. Fork <https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports>.
2. Add the APKBUILD under `community/nordstjernen/APKBUILD` (new packages
   start in `testing/`, then move to `community/` after review).
3. Replace `license="custom"` with the correct SPDX identifier.
4. Verify it builds in a clean chroot with `abuild rootbld` and passes
   `apkbuild-lint` / `apkbuild-shellcheck`.
5. Commit with the message `testing/nordstjernen: new aport` and open a
   merge request against `aports`.
